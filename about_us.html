<h1 style="color:ff5247";>WHAT MADE US GREAT IS STILL WHAT MAKES US GREAT</h1>
<h2 style="color:FFFFFF";>Kings cuisine Corporation, based in Tema, Ghana, is one of the few brands in Ghana that can boast a rich, decades-long history of success and innovation. It all started with one cook who created a soon-to-be world-famous recipe more than 70 years ago, a list of secret herbs and spices scratched out on the back of the door to his kitchen. That cook was Colonel Harland Sanders, of course, and now Kings cuisine is Ghana's most popular restaurant chain, specializing in that same Original Recipe® along with Extra Crispy™ chicken, home-style sides and buttermilk biscuits. We’re at over 23,000  outlets and more than 140 countries and territories around the world. And you know what? There’s still a cook in a kitchen in every last one of them, freshly preparing delicious, complete family meals at affordable prices.</h2>
